## 🚀 **Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Start local development
cd /Users/utkarshgupta/Documents/requiem
python3 -m http.server 3000 --directory ui

# Test backend
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Deploy changes
git add . && git commit -m "Add streaming responses"
git push origin main
```

## 📁 **Key Files to Edit**

### Frontend
- `ui/script.js` - Streaming, workflow approval, file upload
- `ui/index.html` - UI components, forms

### Backend  
- `api/main.py` - SSE endpoints, file upload
- `workers/engine/` - Analysis engines
- `requirements-railway.txt` - New dependencies

### Database
- Need to add PostgreSQL setup
- Session management tables
- File storage configuration

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

By end of tomorrow, user should be able to:
1. ✅ Ask "Analyze AAPL" and see real-time streaming response
2. ✅ Approve multi-step analysis plans before execution
3. ✅ Have conversations persist between browser sessions
4. ✅ Upload CSV file and get portfolio analysis
5. ✅ Export analysis results to PDF
6. ✅ Create account and have query limits

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- Start with streaming responses (biggest UX impact)
- Use existing analysis engines, just add streaming
- Keep file upload simple (CSV first, PDF later)
- Use Railway's PostgreSQL addon for database
- Test each feature end-to-end before moving on
